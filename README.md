## Notes

A primary challenge I faced while creating this app was ensuring that the forked project code was able to run, due to an issue with my computer. To solve this issue, I seeked help from my professor to sort out the issue making it possible for me to continue working on the lab. Another challenge I faced was completing step 2 of the lab. To overcome this, I continued to read through the steps of the lab to figure out my error, which was making sure that I imported the necessary classes in the files.
